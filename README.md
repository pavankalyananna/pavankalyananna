## Projects Spotlight

### Banking Application (Backend System)

**Tech:** Java 17, Spring Boot, REST APIs  
**What it demonstrates:**
- Layered architecture (Controller → Service → Repository)
- DTO ↔ Entity mapping
- Transaction-style operations (deposit / withdraw)
- Clean API design with proper HTTP semantics

**Why it matters:**  
This is not a demo app — it shows how I structure backend code for **clarity, testability, and growth**.

### Spring Security JWT Authentication (Learning Project)

**Tech:** Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT  
**What it demonstrates:**
- Stateless authentication
- Token validation and request filtering
- Role-based access control

**Why it matters:**  
Authentication is a **platform concern**, not just an app feature. This project focuses on understanding it properly.

## Engineering Principles

- Simplicity beats cleverness
- Design for failure, not happy paths
- Infrastructure constraints shape application design
- If it’s hard to reason about, it’s already broken
